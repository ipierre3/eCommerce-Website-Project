💡 This is a SINGLE page web site. The only files you should have (aside from any images) are index.html and styles.css. 

⚠️ Don’t worry about getting your HTML/CSS to look exactly like the design you see - just get it as close as possible while meeting user story requirements!

⚠️ You are not building out the “components” section on page 1 of the eCommerce Prototype PDF - you are building the ENTIRE website design featured on page 2.

# End Result

Your final website will look as close as possible to the design prototype given!
